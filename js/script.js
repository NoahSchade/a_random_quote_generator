/* Both the randomNumber and prevNumber variables store a random number. The "prevNumber" variable stands for "previous number". Only the "prevNumber" 
   variable stores the random number after the loop whereas the "randomNumber" variable generates a random number inside of the loop. The loop evaluates to true
   if the "randomNumber" is the same as the "prevNumber". If they are the same then the loop generates another random number until they are not the same number.
   This is done so the random number is different from the last random number. The reason for doing this is so when I click the "Show another quote" button, 
   I get a new random quote instead of the exact same quote twice in a row.
